This project includes the following technologies: HTML CSS Javascript 

Project description: This project was a continuation of recreating and building upon an established business. I found that their website was extremely dated and needed a face-lift from the Y2K era. My approach with this website was to simplify use and navigation and try creating a good balance of content with white-space. With this approach I could avoid over glamorisation of the website and keep it simple while ensuring an appealing site both visually and functionally for the everyday user. 

The Current Site: https://www.mercuryplastics.co.za/ My Recreation of the site: https://nicholashorta.github.io/mercuryplastics/ 

What building this project taught me: This project gave me further understanding of revising and building upon an already established site, and how to plan around the content given, reducing excess links, pages and content to summarise and structure into relatable sections and areas. It also taught me that simple is beautiful, and that sometimes that is all that is needed. I was also able to give myself the ability to create a logo and animate it as a way to give the website a pulse within its simplicity.
